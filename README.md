## [Coral Bleaching Prediction](https://github.com/jamesbconner/MADS699) <br>
Coral bleaching is a phenomenon that has been taking place across all coral reefs spread out over the world. Healthy coral contains a symbiotic algae; the coral provides a home for the algae and the algae provides food for the coral via photosynthesis. As things like climate change, tourism, and pollution alter this relationship the algae separates from the coral and this results in coral bleaching. Coral bleaching can be easily detected as the coral turns from its normal colors to a stark white color. Can we predict global and local bleaching patterns, and provide information to help local institutions, governments, and organizations mitigate coral bleaching?<br>
## [College Athlete Name Image & Likeness (NIL) Valuation Prediction]() <br>
This project aims to explore student-athlete NIL value further by using supervised and unsupervised methods to consider individual factors like TikTok engagement, performance stats, and media rankings, as well as university characteristics that may impact brand value, including the athletic program's brand engagement. <br>
